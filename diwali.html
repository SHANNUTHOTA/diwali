        <h1 class="title">Happy Diwali</h1>
        
            <p>Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is celebrated with enthusiasm across India and by millions worldwide. It symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. This festival is celebrated over five days, each with its own unique traditions and significance.</p>
            <h2>Significance and Celebrations</h2>
            <p>Diwali commemorates the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after his victory over the demon king Ravana, symbolizing the triumph of virtue. It also honors Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth, inviting her blessings for prosperity and happiness in the year to come. Across various regions, Diwali holds different spiritual meanings but is celebrated with unity and joy.</p>
            <p>The five-day festival includes family gatherings, delicious feasts, vibrant decorations, and the joy of gifting and gratitude. Homes are adorned with diyas (oil lamps), lights, and rangolis (colorful floor patterns) to ward off darkness and welcome positivity and prosperity.</p>
            
            <h2>The Five Days of Diwali</h2>
            <p><strong>Day 1 – Dhanteras:</strong> The festival begins with Dhanteras, a day dedicated to wealth and prosperity. Families clean and decorate their homes, buying gold, silver, or new utensils as a sign of good luck and success.</p>
            <p><strong>Day 2 – Naraka Chaturdashi (Choti Diwali):</strong> This day is focused on inner and outer cleansing, with early morning oil baths symbolizing purification. Diyas are lit in the evening, illuminating homes with warmth and welcoming positive energy.</p>
            <p><strong>Day 3 – Lakshmi Puja:</strong> The most important day of Diwali. People worship Goddess Lakshmi, praying for health, wealth, and prosperity. Families gather for Lakshmi Puja and enjoy elaborate feasts together, celebrating the blessings of abundance and fortune.</p>
            <p><strong>Day 4 – Govardhan Puja:</strong> In some regions, this day is celebrated in honor of Lord Krishna, who lifted the Govardhan mountain to protect villagers from torrential rains. This day signifies protection and gratitude towards nature’s elements.</p>
            <p><strong>Day 5 – Bhai Dooj:</strong> The festival concludes with Bhai Dooj, celebrating the bond between siblings. Brothers and sisters pray for each other’s well-being and share gifts, symbolizing love, protection, and family unity.</p>

            <h2>Diwali Around the World</h2>
            <p>While Diwali is rooted in Hindu mythology, it is celebrated by many religions and communities worldwide, each adding its unique traditions. In Nepal, it’s celebrated as Tihar, honoring animals that share bonds with humans. The festival is recognized in countries with large Indian communities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, often with public Diwali celebrations and festivities.</p>
            
            <h2>Environmental Considerations</h2>
            <p>As environmental awareness grows, many people have begun celebrating Diwali in eco-friendly ways, such as using biodegradable decorations, organic colors for rangolis, and avoiding excessive fireworks to reduce pollution. Embracing a green Diwali reflects respect for nature while preserving the essence of the festival.</p>
